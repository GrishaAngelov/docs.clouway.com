# Drivers

The system provides functionality, to create drivers which to be assigned to different tracking objects. "Drivers"
section allows the user to list, create, edit and delete drivers. In order for the many driver-related functionalities
that the Fleerp system offers to be used,  in addition to the GPS devices, it is necessary that the customer purchase
the following:

- token readers to be installed in the tracking object;
- token chips to be given to the drivers;

The identification is done every time the vehicle is started, by touching the token chip to the token reader. Some of
the functionalities that unlock by using driver identification are:

- ecodriving - driver behaviour on the road;
- following a driver on the map, as well as generating many useful reports about all the trips he has made;
- defining of several driver-related alarms as: "Driver change", "Driver identification", "Unidentified driver";
